But surprise! Behind the curtain, it’s more juggling act than joyride. In our last episode (or blog), we served up real stories, frameworks too. Now lets get a bit more serious.</p><h3 id=peeling-the-cdo-onion>Peeling The CDO Onion…</h3><p>The CDO seat sits at the intersection of business dreams and tech reality, which sounds cool, until you realize you’re navigating two kingdoms with their own languages, priorities, and favorite acronyms.</p><p>Add people, politics, process purgatory, and a dash of cultural resistance, and boom, you’ve got yourself a spicy onion of complexity. Yes, it may stink. Yes, you may cry. But trust me if you want to know whether you’re set up to win or doomed to be the digital scapegoat, this onion must be peeled.</p><h2 id=variables-variables-everywhere>Variables, Variables Everywhere!</h2><p>You could show up every day ready to be the best-ever ‘Chief Digital Officer’ cape on, coffee in hand but this role has more plot twists than a Netflix drama.</p><p>The trick? Learn the variables. Who holds the power? What’s the real appetite for change? What game is actually being played? Once you decode that, you’re not just in the room, you’re running it.</p><p>Let’s talk about someone who cracked the code: <strong>Bertrand Bodson</strong>, CDO at <strong>Novartis</strong> in 2018.</p><p>He didn’t just show up with a digital agenda, he learned the business, built trust, and scaled what mattered. He knew the variables, respected the culture, and changed the narrative. He went from <em>CD-Oh-no</em> to <em>CD-Oh-wow</em> , and made pharma innovation look easy (we all know it’s not😊).</p><h3 id=and-then-comes-global-plot-twists-season-5-was-wild>And Then Comes Global Plot Twists: Season 5 Was Wild</h3><p>The last five years? Whew. Even the best CDOs didn’t have <em>this</em> in their playbook.</p><p>Tariff wars, a global pandemic, Ukraine conflict, supply chain chaos, regulatory whiplash, it’s like the world went premium on unpredictability. New episodes drop weekly.</p><p>Borders got tighter, compliance got louder, and digital went from &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; to &ldquo;basic survival gear.&rdquo;</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the upside: if you’ve made it through this mess and still have your digital ambition (and sense of humor) intact, then congrats. You’re already crisis-proof. The rest is just feature upgrades,</p><h2 id=introducing-the-cdo-checklist>Introducing The CDO Checklist</h2><p>After two decades of helping organizations assess their digital maturity, from strategy and operating models to governance and roadmaps; I realized something simple but powerful: the same tools can help a Chief Digital Officer prepare for success. Because in the end, it all comes down to one question: <em>Can you actually execute your digital agenda?</em></p><p>I originally built a 70-question checklist, but here’s a shorter version to get you started. These questions are grouped into five core dimensions that every CDO must navigate. Miss one, and the whole thing wobbles. Nail them all, and you’re set to lead real change.</p><p><img src=/cdo-conf-2-1.png alt=image.png></p><p>Here’s a quick CDO checklist to help you assess your setup and better understand your enterprise environment. For each question, rate yourself on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.</p><h3 id=collaboration--influence><strong>Collaboration &

your personal experience or expertise (though those matter a lot too). In fact, your background plays a big role in how well you’ll fit and thrive in a given enterprise setup. But that’s a story for another blog series, later!</p></blockquote><h2 id=the-final-verdict>The Final Verdict</h2><p><img src=/cdo-conf-2-2.png alt=image.png>
Now that you’ve scored your enterprise and have an overall average, let’s walk through what it tells you.</p><p><strong>4.0 – 5.0: Green Light! Go!</strong>
You’ve got the runway, the jet fuel, and the air traffic control to back you. Time to take off and lead real change.</p><p><strong>3.0 – 3.9: Proceed with Caution!</strong>
The pieces are there, but not fully in sync. You’ll need to align minds before moving mountains.</p><p><strong>2.0 – 2.9: At Your Own Risk!</strong>
It’s a wobbly setup — tech gaps, trust issues, and governance voids. Your influence game better be strong.</p><p><strong>1.0 – 1.9: No Travel Zone!</strong>
You&rsquo;re set up to fail unless something changes. Patch the basics, clarify the mandate, and manage expectations like a pro.</p><h2 id=a-starting-point-for-navigating-complex-realities>A Starting Point for Navigating Complex Realities</h2><p>The summary score and final verdict above provide a simplified view of a complex framework intended only as a starting point. I’ve deliberately left out the time dimension, even though timing is just as critical as any of the variables mentioned. This overview reflects only the average scope, not the true nuance of each of the five dimensions or their specific relevance to you and your enterprise. The <strong>real insight emerges</strong> when we visualize your unique situation using a radar chart, <strong>mapping scores across each dimension to reflect the true profile of your organization</strong>. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to explore this further.</p><h2 id=stay-tuned><strong>Stay Tuned!</strong></h2><p>That’s a wrap on the CDO Checklist! Whether you scored high and are riding a digital unicorn, landed in the middle juggling strategy, or found yourself facing a dragon; you’ve got a clearer view of the game. But don’t put down your cape just yet. In Part 3, we’ll uncover the secrets of Digital Governance, your ultimate secret weapon to cut through chaos and avoid becoming the Chief Disappointment Officer😉. Stay tuned, your digital adventure is just getting started!</p></section><div class=divider></div><section class=space-y-4><article><div id=tcomment></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/twikoo@1.6.41/dist/twikoo.min.js></script><script>twikoo.init({envId:"https://benevolent-tartufo-23106e.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/twikoo",el:"#tcomment",path:"/posts/cdo-confessions-part-2/",lang:"en"})</script></article></section></article></div><div x-data=tocHighlighter() @scroll.window=debouncedScroll class="hidden lg:flex lg:flex-col lg:items-end"></div></div><footer class="flex justify-between items-center gap-2 px-4 py-12"><div><p>© 2025 Neelima's Blogs & Articles</p><p>Connecting the ‘why’ of business with the ‘how’ of technology</p></div><div x-data="{ icons: [
